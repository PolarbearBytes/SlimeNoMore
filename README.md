# Slime No More!!!

Hate dealing with slimes or having to use carpets or other things to spawn proof an area?

Simply use the configured shortcut key and slime spawning will be toggled on or off for the current chunk you are in.

As of 1.2.0 permissions are now enforced. Singleplayer and Hosted lan games are always allowed to toggle slime spawning, otherwise use a Permission Manager like LuckPerms to set permissions for `slime-no-more.toggleSlimeSpawning`

Also with 1.2.0 overlay indicators were added to visualize which chunks have been marked as not allowing slime spawning.

## Shortcuts

`Delete` - Toggle allowing spawning in the current chunk the player is in

`Insert` - Toggle the general rendering of visual indicators

`Page Up` - Toggles rendering the cube part of visual indicators

`Page Down` - Toggles rendering the billboard icon part of visual indicators
